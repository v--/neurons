# Biological neural network simulation

TODO: Documentation

Believe me, you wouldn't understand anything without documentation

Future notes:

__x_total__  "Lenght of the axon (cm)"
__t_total__  "Total process time (ms)"
__a__        "Axonal radius (micro m)"
__rho__      "Cytoplasm resistivity (ohm-m)"
__cap__      "Square unit capacitance (micro F/cm^2)"
__g_na__     "Maximal sodium conductance (mS/cm^2)"
__g_k__      "Maximal potassium conductance (mS/cm^2)"
__g_l__      "Maximal leakage conductance (mS/cm^2)"
__v_na__     "Sodium diffusion potential (mV)"
__v_k__      "Potassium diffusion potential (mV)"
__v_l__      "Leakage diffusion potential (mV)"
__v_0__      "Initial voltage (mV)"
__temp__     "Temperature (deg C)"
__seg_x__    "Number of space data points
